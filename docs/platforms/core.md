# Core 

IronShield Core is the intelligence center of IronShield security infrastructure. It generates, verifyies, and authenticates **adaptive proof of work challenges**. It also provides advanced bot detection, behavioral analysis, and fingerprinting.

## Overview

The Core platform functions as the primary gatekeeper in front of protected services. Any incoming request to a protected service must solve a proof-of-work computational challenge described in detail below. After successful completion of the challenge, it forwards the incoming traffic to the protected service. Since IronShield challenges are adaptive, the privacy-preserving fingerprinting engine can serve much more difficult challenges to traffic it sees as malicious, such as automated AI-driven scrapers or DDoS attacks, effectively blocking them.


## Understanding Proof of Work Verification

Before diving into the technical implementation, it's important to understand **what Proof of Work (PoW)** verification accomplishes and why it's effective against automated attacks.

### What is Proof of Work?

**Proof of Work** is a cryptographic mechanism that requires a client to perform a computationally expensive operation to prove they have expended real computational resources, most famously implemented in Bitcoin mining. IronShield's similar protocol consists of the following:

- **Challenge**: IronShield provides a mathematical puzzle that requires significant CPU cycles to solve. The "work" is the energy expended a device needs to solve the challenge.
- **Solution**: The client must find a specific value (usually called a "nonce") that, when combined with the provided challenge data, produces a cryptographic hash (e.g. SHA-256) with certain properties.
- **Verification**: Any independent party can easily and quickly verify the solution is correct without having to recompute the soluition from scratch, but can be certain that the solver initially found it utilizing substantial computational work.

### Why PoW Stops Bad Actors
The problem with traditional automated attacks (bots, scrapers, DDoS) is that anybody with 20 minutes of effort and 50 dollars can bring a multi-million dollar system offline because spamming endpoints is incredibly cheap to do yet extremly costly to defend againt.

IronShield Core turns scraping and DDoS protection from a networking problem to an economic one. Attacks become economically unfeasible when each request requires significant computational cost. Malicious actors can't easily scale attacks because each request demands real CPU time and energy consumption to the point where the assymetric cost IronShield creates would make an attack economically infeasible. On the other hand, the "cost" to real users solving occasional challenges is imperceptible since they only have to solve one challenge and can use all of their computer's hardware to do so for free.

## How IronShield's PoW Functions

### What a PoW Challenge Looks Like
IronShield's protocol primarily communicates with HTTP headers, for more information see the [API Platform Documentation](/docs/platforms/api).

**Example Decoded Header Content:**
```json
IronShieldChallenge {
  random_nonce: "55a77bde84950b2a2a525885902a6b13",
  created_time: 1753923084753,
  expiration_time: 1753923114753,
  website_id: "ironshield-edge",
  challenge_param: "[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",
  recommended_attempts: 10000000,
  public_key: "[4, 1, 218, 71, 15, 1, 1, 7, 64, 75, 121, 0, 46, 128, 52, 26, 55, 136, 20, 182, 107, 189, 54, 235, 41, 1, 241, 143, 183, 142, 125, 60]",
  challenge_signature: "[80, 117, 53, 94, 228, 123, 162, 251, 221, 72, 66, 74, 202, 33, 225, 97, 34, 176, 138, 89, 32, 207, 247, 204, 221, 119, 194, 221, 172, 108, 190, 43, 127, 174, 95, 27,41, 160, 180, 20, 102, 152, 129, 222, 35, 79, 219, 106, 243, 86, 28, 99, 70, 151, 200, 101, 153, 98, 149, 167, 142, 139, 229, 5]"
}
```

#### What Each Field Means
- **`random_nonce`**:         The SHA-256 hash of a random number (hex string)
- **`created_time`**:         Unix milli timestamp for the challenge.
- **`expiration_time`**:      Unix milli timestamp for the challenge expiration time.
- **`challenge_param`**:      Target threshold - hash must be less than this value.
- **`recommended_attempts`**: Expected number of attempts for user guidance (2x difficulty).
- **`website_id`**:           The identifier of the website.
- **`public_key`**:           Ed25519 public key for signature verification.
- **`challenge_signature`**:  Ed25519 signature over the challenge data.

### The Computational Challenge
To solve an `IronShieldChallenge`, a client must find some `solution` that concatenates with the `random_nonce`, such that when this new value is hashed with SHA-256 the resulting hash represented as a *[u8; 32] big-endian byte array* is  smaller than the `challenge_param` target threshold byte array. The lower the `challenge_param` is, the harder the challenge is.

For example, the average probability of finding a SHA-256 hash less than 2^255 represented as a [u8; 32] byte array ([0, 0, 0, ..., 128]) is 50%, since there is a 50% chance any random integer chosen between 0 and 2^256 will be less than 2^255. This can be represented mathematically as the probability of solving a given challenge on any attempt as `challenge_param / 2^256`. Therefore, the difficulty, or the expected average number of attempts to solve a challenge, is `2^256 / challenge_param`.

### Random Nonce
The `random_nonce` is a SHA-256 hash of a random number represented as a hex string generated by IronShield servers. Since clients have to find a valid nonce that produces a specific SHA-256 output, it is essential that instead of the nonce itself producing a hash, it must be combined with some randomness generated by the servers to prevent an attacker from precomputing valid hashes. The presence of a random nonce the solution nonce needs to be concatenated with ensures that the only possible solution to a given challenge was one computed on the spot after the client received it.

More traditional PoW algorithms like Bitcoin's usually require the solution nonce to be hashed twice to prevent against [length-extension attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack), but the `random_nonce` ensures that there will always be a non-user-generated fixed-length input into the hash. Reducing the authentication server workload per request to 1 hash instead of 2 may not seem like a lot. However, for a server authenticating hundreds of thousands, if not millions of requests per second, this simple architecture choice reduces the expected computational cost by 50%.

### Creation and Expiration Times
The `creation_time` and `expiration_time` timestamps in unix millis are more for the authentication server than the client. It allows a server to store old challenges as well as when they were created, and ensure that a client can't submit new solutions to old challenges. If every challenge has an expiration date, clients will have to continuously solve new challenges.

### Target threshold
The `challenge_param` is simply a number represented as a *[u8; 32] big-endian byte array*. The output of SHA-256 hash is fundamentally a 256-bit number that can also be represented as the same type of byte array. Therefore, [lexicographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) comparison can be used between these 2 byte arrays to find out which one is smaller. In IronShield's case, its PoW algorithm is searching for a hash that is less than the target threshold specified by the `challenge_param`.

A target threshold also allows IronShield to be able to granularly modify the difficulty of a challenges, which the `recommended_attempts` is derived from (2x difficulty). The difficulty can be as easy as 2 expected attempts, to 1 million, to 100 million, to trillions. This is much mroe advantaguous compared to aglorithms that want to find a sha-256 hash with other specific properties, like the number of leading zeroes in a hash. Although it isn't a perfect analogy, if we look at the difficulty of a challenge in terms of big *O* notation, similar to time or space complexity, where *O* is the difficulty of a challenge in terms of the expected number of attempts and *n* is varied paramater like the number of leading zeros desired, the difficulty of a leading-zero challenge will be *O(16‚Åø)*. This would result in a difficulty of 1.05 million for 5 leading zeros, 16.78 million for 6 leading zeros, and 268.44 million for 7 leading zeros. The lack of granularity in terms of difficulty scaling prevents the ability to serve slightly harder challenges to more suspicious traffic. Any proof-of-work system using this would realistically only be able to serve relatively easy or extremly difficult challenges to traffic. In contrast, the `challenge_param` target threshold can be linearly varied since is jsut a number between 0 and 2^256, so its difficulty in big O notation would be *O(n)*, and can be granuarly scaled to whatever difficulty necessary, to serve easier challenges to people on phones and harder challenges to those on desktops, and much much much arder ones to suspected bots.

### Website Identificaton
The `website_id` is simply a url or identifier to the desired endpoint a client is trying to reach by solving a challenge. This is necessary for server-side billing and authentication, since as described in the [API platform documentation](/docs/platforms/api) the verification process can be offline, as this would be the only way a server would know which origin to forward client traffic to.

### Keys and Signatures
The `public_key` and `challenge_signature` exist for any indepdent third party to verify the authenticity of challenges. The `public_key` can be extracted from the public PGP key block belonging to software [at] ironshield.cloud posted to keys.openpgp.org. The challenge_signature over the challenge data can also be verified by any indpendent third party to have been generated by the owner of the corresponding private key to the `public_key`, which proves an authentic IronShield server created the challenge.

## PoW Verification
The verification process is quite similar to the solving process, except in this case, the solution has already been provided. All the verification server has to do is run through one iteration of the proof-of-work algorithm toe nsure the nonce is valid, and then redirect then issue a solution token.

#### What Each Field Means
- **`solved_challenge`**: The now solved challenge issued to client
- **`solution`**:         Valid solution nonce

### Challenge Response
The `solved_challenge` is simply an exact copy of the original IronShieldChallenge issued to the client. It allows the server to verify the client is submitting the solution for the exact challenge they issued the client. The `solution` is a signed 64-bit integer that is converted to a *[u8; 8] little-endian byte array*. The `random_nonce` is converted to a *[u8; 32] little-endian byte array*. They are then added to a SHA-256 hashing object and hashed. The output *[u8; 32] big-endian byte array* is compared against the target threshold `challenge_param `byte array of the same type to ensure the hash is less than the target threshold. This is the same process used in the original PoW solving.
